# Plasma Proteome

The plasma projects aims to perform reanalysis of plasma proteome datasets in PRIDE Archive and provide to the user absolute intensity values.  

### Select datasets

For absolute expression projects, we have a set of rules to select the project to be annotated:

- Samples MUST be from healthy/normal tissues.
